# tryGraphQL
Implemented basic operations of GraphQL including queries and mutations and created a schema to support query and mutation operations. 

Registered GraphQL with Express, utilized json-server to make a data store to test the GraphQL schema.
Utilized axios to send HTTP request from json-server to GraphQL and used nodemon to restart the nodejs server automatically.
